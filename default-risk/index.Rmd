# Motivation & Objectives

---

## Motivation

> "Debt contracts often require borrowers to pledge collateral.  Merris (1979) reports that a Federal Reserve survey involving 340 banks found that approximately 40% of all short-term, and 60% of all commercial loans were _secured_ between 1977 and 1979.  **Despite this, the research on collateral is limited.**"

> "We develop a model in which banks compete for borrowers and deposits are elastically supplied."

### **3 Main Questions**

1. Under what conditions is there a positive association between borrower risk and collateral, as documented empirically by Orgler (1970)?

1. What is the economic role of collateral under private information and moral hazard?

1. How does monetary policy affect the cross-sectional dispersion of unsecured and secured lending?

## The Model

### Setup 

> "We assume universal risk neutrality and view banks as competing for both loans and deposits in a perfectly competitive credit market.  **Deposits are elastically supplied at the riskless rate.**"

#### Ergo,
1. Depositors receive an expected return equal to the riskless rate
1. Borrowers expected utilities are maximized subject to informational and breakeven constraints
1. banks earn zero expected profits

_In this economy, there are two points in time, **t = 0 and t = 1**, the initial point and terminal point, respectively._  

**The borrower may be defined within _A_, such that**

]

### Setup

**Given the assumptions already made, we can understand that:**

![](img/a1.png)

Condition (A1) implies that the good borrower has a higher success probability than the bad borrower for any given action.  **This in turn implies that the _maximum_ possible improvement in the success probability for the good borrower is _smaller_ than that for the bad borrower.**  
- This implications assumes that the marginal impact of action on a borrower's success probability is _decreasing_ in borrower quality:

### The First Best Solution

> The first best equilibrium includes no moral hazard, and no private information. 

When both _a_ and _theta_ are observable to the lender, a borrow would solve below, where r is one plus the riskless interest rate.  The borrower chooses to maximize the value of its project net of the $1 investment for one period at _r_ :

![](img/maxa2.png)

Below, **_a lower-bar_ is optimal for the good borrower if (A3) conditions are met.**  Conversely, **_a upper_bar_ is optimal for the bad borrower if (A4) conditions are met.**  These conditions are compatible with (A1) and (A2).

## Policy Implications

### Testable Predictions

1. Despite deadweight costs associated with collateral, we should expect it to be widely used to cope with moral hazard and private information problems.
1. An increase in the (real) riskless interest rate increases collateral levels in secured loans, in both the second and third best equilibria. 
1. An increase in the (real) riskless rate increases interest on all loans, in both the second and third best equilibria.
1. A reduction in the dissipative cost of collateral reduces the level of collateral used in the second best equilibrium.
1. An increase in the loan size decreases the amount of collateral used in the second best equilibrium.

# Conclusions

## Conclusions

> "Because private information may either accentuate or retard the positive relationship between collateral requirements and borrower risk encountered with just moral hazard, higher collateral may be posted by either safer or riskier borrowers.  **Moreover, borrower risk is endogenous and an outcome of the equilibrium.**"

- Higher interest rates in the economy lead to both higher equilibrium loan interest rates and higher equilibrium collateral requirements

- A decline in the dissipative costs of collateral or an increase in the loan size lead to lower equilibrium collateral utilization

- Over half of all loans in the authors sample period were secured, with a temporal increase in secured lending

- Larger loans and loans of longer maturity also have less collateral
