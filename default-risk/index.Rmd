# Motivation & Objectives

---

## Motivation

> "Debt contracts often require borrowers to pledge collateral.  Merris (1979) reports that a Federal Reserve survey involving 340 banks found that approximately 40% of all short-term, and 60% of all commercial loans were _secured_ between 1977 and 1979.  **Despite this, the research on collateral is limited.**"

### **3 Main Questions**

1. Under what conditions is there a positive association between borrower risk and collateral, as documented empirically by Orgler (1970)?

1. What is the economic role of collateral under private information and moral hazard?

1. How does monetary policy affect the cross-sectional dispersion of unsecured and secured lending?

---

## Objectives

> "We develop a model in which banks compete for borrowers and deposits are elastically supplied."

## The Model

### Setup 

> "We assume universal risk neutrality and view banks as competing for both loans and deposits in a perfectly competitive credit market.  **Deposits are elastically supplied at the riskless rate.**"

#### Ergo,
1. Depositors receive an expected return equal to the riskless rate
1. Borrowers expected utilities are maximized subject to informational and breakeven constraints
1. banks earn zero expected profits

_In this economy, there are two points in time, **t = 0 and t = 1**, the initial point and terminal point, respectively._  

**The borrower may be defined within _A_, such that**

### Setup

**Given the assumptions already made, we can understand that:**

![](img/a1.png)

Condition (A1) implies that the good borrower has a higher success probability than the bad borrower for any given action.  **This in turn implies that the _maximum_ possible improvement in the success probability for the good borrower is _smaller_ than that for the bad borrower.**  
- This implications assumes that the marginal impact of action on a borrower's success probability is _decreasing_ in borrower quality:

### The First Best Solution

> The first best equilibrium includes no moral hazard, and no private information.
