## Motivation & Data 

---

### Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (The Code)

_The current Bankruptcy Code was enacted in 1978 and became effective on October 1, 1979._ 

- This current code completely replaced the former Bankruptcy Act of 1898

 - While the current code has been amended multiple times since 1978, but the core enactment is still used today

- Most notably, this iteration of the code developed Chapter 11
  
  - Prior codes accounted for 'general provisions', 'case administration', 'creditors and debtors', and 'liquidation'
  - Chapter 11 now allowed for 'reorganization'
  - In most instances, Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings leave the debtor in control of its business operations - with some oversight
    
- Chapter 11 Plan

 - 120 days to reorganize, a judge must approve (plausible without creditors)

### Data  

_Firms filing for bankruptcy from 1980 (44,000) jumped by 1986 (81,000)_

.pull-left[

37 New York Stock Exchanges (NYSE) and American Stock Exchange (AMEX) firms that filed petitions under the 1979 Code between October 1, November 1979 and December 31, 1986

  1. SEC's annual report to Congress (contains all presentations by the SEC to bankruptcy courts)
  1. The _Wall Street Journal Index_ listing of all firms that declare bankruptcy
  1. _Compustat's_ Research File listing all firms dropped because of bankruptcy files
  1. Firms listed as suspended or deleted from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) tapes
]

.pull-right[

Financial institutions are excluded because they are not subject to the standard provisions of the bankruptcy code.  Because court documents are available only at the federal court where the petition is filed, budget and time constraints, data collection was confined to the following seven jurisdictions: 

- Central District of California
- Southern District of Florida
- Northern District of Illinois
- District of Massachusetts
- Northern District of Michigan 
- Southern District of New York
- Northern District of Ohio

### Data

- Among these federal court locations, there were a total of 51 filings in the initial sample, but an additional 14 firms were excluded because:
  1. Their bankruptcies were not resolved by May 31, 1989
  1. Their data were being used by a bankruptcy judge and hence were not available for study
  1. Their data had been removed from the court to an archive
  
- The final sample contains 37 firms with substantially shorter bankruptcy petition to resolution timing (2.5 years on average) relative to prior studies (12.5 years, Warner - 1977) 

- These firms' ratio of debt to total assets is also 77%, 50% higher than the 51% listed on Compustat for all nonbankrupt firms

## Direct Costs of Bankruptcy

### Direct vs Indirect Costs

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Direct Costs]

The direct costs of bankruptcy are the legal and other professional and administrative fees associated with the bankruptcy filing; they represent the measurable part of all bankruptcy costs.  

Three measures are used to asses the magnitude of the direct costs of bankruptcy: 

1. Market value of equity
1. Book value of debt plus the market value of equity
1. Book value of total assets

- Market value of debt is not used because too few firms had any publicly traded debt 
- Book value of debt is readily available and is used as a proxy for the market value of equity
- The book value of total assets is used to ensure the results are not overstated by the large drop in market value of equity that occurs before the bankruptcy filing (Weiss, 1989)

]
.panel[.panel-name[Indirect Costs]

The indirect bankruptcy costs are the uneasurable opportunity costs, including: 

1. Lost sales and a decline in the value of inventory
1. Increased operating costs, loss of employees and suppliers
1. A reduction in the firm's competitiveness

]
.panel[.panel-name[Key Findings]

#### Direct Costs of Bankruptcy 
1. 20.6% of the market value of equity
1. 3.1 % of the book value of debt plus the market value of equity
1. 2.8% of the book value of total assets

#### In Contrast To
- 25% (Stanley and Girth, 1971) - total assets from financial statements
- 7.5% (Ang, Chua, and McConnell, 1982) - liquidated value of firms
- 4% (Warner, 1977) - mostly heavily regulated railroads included
