.panel[.panel-name[History of Moral Hazard]


_"The critical component of the economic mechanism of moral hazard is the rational belief or expectation by market participants of outside intervention in adverse states of the world."_

.pull-left[
#### How does this apply?
Since Fannie Mae was established (1930s), the U.S. Government has promoted home ownership in its contemporary fashion.  The Community Reinvestment Act led to more low-income and urban community lending.  

#### What does this mean?
Financial risk taking by politically connected firms only makes sense if management at financial institutions had good reason to believe that the government would get involved.
]
.pull-right[
#### This Publication 
- Any mid-tier financial institution _believes_ they have clout above others
- These same institutions have reason to expect this (e.g., political connections)

#### Other Examples
- "Any situation in which one person makes the decision about how much risk to take, while someone else bears the cost if things go badly." - Paul Krugman
- "The Greenspan put"

]

.panel[.panel-name['08 Precursor]

#### Pre-crisis
_"Did they [political connections] play a role in risk taking by financial institutions that preceded the 2008 financial crisis?"_
**A history of bailouts**
- Continental Illinois (1984)
- Savings and Loan (S&amp;L, '80s &amp; '90s)
- Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM, 1998)

#### Post-crisis
- To rescue or not to rescue (Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG)? 
- Finds firms with higher __precrisis__ leverage were more likely to go bankrupt and had lower stock returns
- This result illustrates the negative effects of moral hazard

]
.panel[.panel-name[Subprime Market]
.pull-left[

#### Growing Power of Fannie and Freddie

- A growing subprime market (and collapse)
- Government power in mortgage markets =&gt; established political connections

1. Countrywide Financial lends below-market to Fannie Mae CEO and Senate Budget Committee Chairman
1. Citigroup brought former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin on-board
1. Enron established "close connections" to the Bush (W.) administration

# Data &amp; Senate Banking Committee

---

# Data

_The population for this study consists of all financial firms (SIC codes 6000-6999) trading on the NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq from 1973 through 2009.  Keeping with the literature, American Depository Receipts (ADRs), Real Estate Investments Trusts (REITs), foreign-based firms, close-end funds, etc. are excluded (only including stocks with CRSP codes of 10 or 11)._

.pull-left[
#### Databases:
- Official Congressional Directory (historical membership of the Senate Banking Committee)
- OpenSecrets - Center for Responsive Politics (lobbying data)
- Boardex (politically connected directors at financial institutions)
- Compustat (balance sheet data)
- CRSP (stock-level data)
- Thomson Financial (insider holdings)
- HUD (subprime housing data)
]
.pull-right[
#### A not-so-even split:
- Control for natural log of firm assets (size)
- Also control for ROA, cash holdings, dividends, and book-to-market ratio (scaled by assets and winsorized at 1% and 99%)
- Calculated _Housing Price Growth_ (quarterly growth in the median)
- Included a _Subprime_ dummy (control)
- 34 public firms from 2003 - 2008 that were either subprime lenders or have subprime lender subsidiaries.

# Senate Banking Committee

_"Financial institutions that are located in a state with a senator on the Banking Committee potentially have a powerful ally that can improve their chances of survival if their exposure to risk leads to negative outcomes."_

&lt;iframe width="600" height="400" src="img/bankingupdated.mp4" title="Senate Banking Committee" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
]
.pull-right[
**"The United State Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs"**
- Jurisdiction includes banking, insurance, financial markets, securities, international trade and finance, and economic policy
- Confirm heads of executive departments and government agencies (e.g., Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the SEC)
- Senators have additional leverage over government officials because of their advise and consent power to confirm these officials
- Most domestic financial institutions operate within state boundaries (e.g., United Bank of Iowa)
- Avoid issues with census restructuring and movement around representatives

# '08 Financial Crisis

# '08 Financial Crisis

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Datetime]

&gt; "I next focus in on financial firm decisions during the US housing bubble and the ensuing financial crisis (from 2003 through 2008)

#### Two difficulties in assessing risk-taking behavior:

1. Opportunities for financial institutions to engage in risky behavior don't always exist even in the presence of moral hazard
1. Tail risk can be difficult to measure because, by definition, it adversely affects the firm only during a very rare event

#### The mid-2000s in the US:

1. The opportunity for making loans due to the housing boom created more cross-sectional variation in risk taking
1. The resulting bust was one of those rare events in which the consequences of tail risk and the associated government intervention can be seen

]
.panel[.panel-name[Leverage]
#### Leverage is used to define the risk exposure of firms before and after the crisis.

**A natural measure of firm risk exposure, _defined in this paper_ as the ratio of a firm's book value of debt to its book value of assets.**
- Even while firms are subject to regulatory capital requirements, there is substantial variation in the use of leverage by banks, Gropp and Heider (2010)
- This suggests, assuming banks attempt to abide by regulatory constraints, that capital requirements are only of secon-order importance in determining capital structure
- Leverage may omit other forms of firms' exposure to risk, daily stock volatility is also calculated (standard deviation of daily returns across a calendar year) as an additional measure
]
.panel[.panel-name[Methodology]

_Initial summary statistics suggest that **the Committee Senator dummy variable is not picking up some important differences in firm characteristics** that can explain the subsequent results._

#### Table 5

- First, **run probit regression** of the _Committee Senator_ dummy variable on firm characteristics at the start of the housing bubble
  - Columns 1 and 2 show that none of the firm characteristics predicted the presence of a committee senator
- For comparison, run OLS regressions of two other measures of political connections - **lobbying spending and political directors** - on firm characteristics at the same time
  - Columns 3 through 6 reveal that many firm characteristics predicted lobbying spending or political directors (or both)
  
_Table 5 will show the advantage of using a more exogenous measure like Committee Senator as opposed to firm choice variables like lobbying spending and political directors... **the former is not a function of firm characteristics, and thus stems from political connections themselves and not due to some omitted variables.**_

]
.panel[.panel-name[Bailouts]

#### TARP
Treasury established several programs under the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) in October 2008.  Congress initially authorized $700 billion through TARP, but this was reduced to $475 billion by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).

.pull-left[
- $250 billion to banking institutions
- $27 billion to "restart credit markets"
]
.pull-right[
- $82 billion to U.S. Auto
- $70 billion to AIG
- $46 billion to families avoiding foreclosure
]

#### Dodd-Frank

Following TARP, Dodd-Frank (2010) was enacted sweeping reforms - a direct response to '08 and TARP. _Repealed under Trump administration (2018)._

# Primary Results

---

## Primary Results

In the sample from 1973 - 2009, the author finds a **positive relationship between political connections and risk taking**, as measured by both stock volatility and leverage ratios

In a more narrow sample, the author finds that politically connected firms had higher leverage prior to the 2008 financials crisis **and increased their leverage more in response to local housing price growth** (HUD)

- **But** they were also less likely to go bankrupt or insolvent during and after the financial crisis and had higher stock returns during the crisis

#### Robustness

Dropping New York City (potentially endogenously higher probabliity of New York representation on the Senate Banking Committee could exist) from all tests yields no significant change to the main results.  

Dropping Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (under implicit guarantee so their behavior could dictate findings) does not change the main results

# Conclusion

---

## Conclusion

_"The critical component of the economic mechanism of moral hazard is the rational belief or expectation by market participants of outside intervention in adverse states of the world."_


Moral hazard has been a staple of economic theory since the 1960s, **but economists know little about how firm incentives are affected by potential future government intervention.**
  - This persists, but much more granular data does give promise to future studies of moral hazard
  
There have been a number of new campaign finance laws and court rulings in the last decade _(Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission)_

- How doe these impact corporate campaign expenditures?

- How do these findings impact industries like defense (Senate Armed Services Committee) and health care (Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee)?
