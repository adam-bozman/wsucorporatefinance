.panel[.panel-name[History of Moral Hazard]


_"The critical component of the economic mechanism of moral hazard is the rational belief or expectation by market participants of outside intervention in adverse states of the world."_

.pull-left[
#### How does this apply?
Since Fannie Mae was established (1930s), the U.S. Government has promoted home ownership in its contemporary fashion.  The Community Reinvestment Act led to more low-income and urban community lending.  

#### What does this mean?
Financial risk taking by politically connected firms only makes sense if management at financial institutions had good reason to believe that the government would get involved.
]
.pull-right[
#### This Publication 
- Any mid-tier financial institution _believes_ they have clout above others
- These same institutions have reason to expect this (e.g., political connections)

#### Other Examples
- "Any situation in which one person makes the decision about how much risk to take, while someone else bears the cost if things go badly." - Paul Krugman
- "The Greenspan put"

]

]
.panel[.panel-name['08 Financial Crisis]

#### Pre-crisis
_"Did they [political connections] play a role in risk taking by financial institutions that preceded the 2008 financial crisis?"_
**A history of bailouts**
- Continental Illinois (1984)
- Savings and Loan (S&L, '80s & '90s)
- Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM, 1998)

-- 
#### Post-crisis
- To rescue or not to rescue (Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG)? 
- Finds firms with higher __precrisis__ leverage were more likely to go bankrupt and had lower stock returns
- This result illustrates the negative effects of moral hazard

]
.panel[.panel-name[Subprime Market]
.pull-left[

#### Growing Power of Fannie and Freddie

- A growing subprime market (and collapse)
- Government power in mortgage markets => established political connections

1. Countrywide Financial lends below-market to Fannie Mae CEO and Senate Budget Committee Chairman
1. Citigroup brought former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin on-board
1. Enron established "close connections" to the Bush (W.) administration

# Data

_The population for this study consists of all financial firms (SIC codes 6000-6999) trading on the NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq from 1973 through 2009.  Keeping with the literature, American Depository Receipts (ADRs), Real Estate Investments Trusts (REITs), foreign-based firms, close-end funds, etc. are excluded (only including stocks with CRSP codes of 10 or 11)._

.pull-left[
#### Databases:
- Official Congressional Directory (historical membership of the Senate Banking Committee)
- OpenSecrets - Center for Responsive Politics (lobbying data)
- Boardex (politically connected directors at financial institutions)
- Compustat (balance sheet data)
- CRSP (stock-level data)
- Thomson Financial (insider holdings)
- HUD (subprime housing data)
]
.pull-right[
#### A not-so-even split:
- Control for natural log of firm assets (size)
- Also control for ROA, cash holdings, dividends, and book-to-market ratio (scaled by assets and winsorized at 1% and 99%)
- Calculated _Housing Price Growth_ (quarterly growth in the median)
- Included a _Subprime_ dummy (control)
- 34 public firms from 2003 - 2008 that were either subprime lenders or have subprime lender subsidiaries.

# Senate Banking Committee

# Senate Banking Committee

_"Financial institutions that are located in a state with a senator on the Banking Committee potentially have a powerful ally that can improve their chances of survival if their exposure to risk leads to negative outcomes."_

.pull-right[
**"The United State Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs"**
- Jurisdiction includes banking, insurance, financial markets, securities, international trade and finance, and economic policy
- Confirm heads of executive departments and government agencies (e.g., Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the SEC)
- Senators have additional leverage over government officials because of their advise and consent power to confirm these officials
- Most domestic financial institutions operate within state boundaries (e.g., United Bank of Iowa)
- Avoid issues with census restructuring and movement around representatives

.panel[.panel-name[Leverage]
#### Leverage is used to define the risk exposure of firms before and after the crisis.

**A natural measure of firm risk exposure, _defined in this paper_ as the ratio of a firm's book value of debt to its book value of assets.**
- Even while firms are subject to regulatory capital requirements, there is substantial variation in the use of leverage by banks, Gropp and Heider (2010)
- This suggests, assuming banks attempt to abide by regulatory constraints, that capital requirements are only of secon-order importance in determining capital structure
- Leverage may omit other forms of firms' exposure to risk, daily stock volatility is also calculated (standard deviation of daily returns across a calendar year) as an additional measure

#### TARP
Treasury established several programs under the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) in October 2008.  Congress initially authorized $700 billion through TARP, but this was reduced to $475 billion by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).

.pull-left[
- $250 billion to banking institutions
- $27 billion to "restart credit markets"
]
.pull-right[
- $82 billion to U.S. Auto
- $70 billion to AIG
- $46 billion to families avoiding foreclosure
]

#### Dodd-Frank

Following TARP, Dodd-Frank (2010) was enacted sweeping reforms - a direct response to '08 and TARP. _Repealed under Trump administration (2018)._
